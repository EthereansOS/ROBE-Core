###### An open standard based on Ethereum ERC 721 to build unique NFT with XML informations

## Abstract

A standard to integrate XML code into Non Fungible Tokens, to set a standard to decentralize non financial things like documents, art and even burnable or scriptable applications. 

## Decentralized?

Computational law, DAOs and scripted contracts will be the future of our society, but there is a lack of opportunity for non scripted things

## Why XML?

The challange is to help people to decentralize into the Public chain in an unstoppable and not manipulable way important informations. XML is the most adaptable and readable standard for every browser. 

Using XML is the best way to transact informations like documents, at the same time img files using an SVG standard, and code, like the the view of a Dapp reducing the needs of centralized servers or distributed file sharing integration. 

## The Standard

The standard is designed to be a general purpose Smart Contract to help everyone to decentralize pieces of information that are redable from every device.
