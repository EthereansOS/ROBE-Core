###### An open standard based on Ethereum ERC 721 to build unique NFT with XML informations

## Abstract

A standard to integrate XML code into Non Fungible Tokens, to set a standard to decentralize non financial things like documents, art and even burnable or scriptable applications. 

## Decentralize non scripted things?

Computational law, DAOs, and scripted contracts will be the future of our society, but there is a lack of opportunity for non-scripted things like documents, art, and everything that have to deal with the offline world like institutions or cultural usages. In this decade we'll see a transition from a centralized way to rule our society to a decentralized one, we believe that in the middle of it we need to validate things, not just script without trust entities.

The opportunity of ERC-721 standard is to build unstoppable unique pieces of information that can help us to use the Blockchain Technology non-financial things. 

For example, we can use NFT to publish a not-manipulable document, with the request to sign it from selected wallets or like to transact the information of the building of a painting by chained NFTs for every action that the artist makes solving a lot of problems in the more possible decentralized way.

## Why XML?

The challange is to help people to decentralize into the Public chain in an unstoppable and not manipulable way important informations. XML is the most adaptable and readable standard for every browser. 

Using XML is the best way to transact informations like documents, at the same time img files using an SVG standard, and code, like the the view of a Dapp reducing the needs of centralized servers or distributed file sharing integration. 

## The Standard

The standard is designed to be a general purpose Smart Contract to help everyone to decentralize pieces of information that are redable from every device.
